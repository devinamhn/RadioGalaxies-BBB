The main branch has changed quite a bit over the last few years. Check out the reproduce branch for a minimal working example and replicate results from the 'Approx Bayesian Inference' paper.

## Training
 

- Run bbb_ensemble.py to train 10 variational inference models with different random seeds and random shuffling between training  and validation datasets 
- Use the config_augment.txt to run vi with data agumentation
